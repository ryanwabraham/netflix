# Netflix Sorting Demo
I love Netflix. I watch it every night. However anyone who uses Netflix knows that if you don't have a specific title in mind, it can be difficult to find something to watch.

When searching for a title, people tend to waste a great deal of time tediously scrolling through titles, committing factors to memory (such as genre, duration, cast, release date, and acclaim), and mentally weighing their options.

I thought it would be nice to have a filtering feature, and that's why I put this demo together.

It's built with Node, React, and the Movie DB API
